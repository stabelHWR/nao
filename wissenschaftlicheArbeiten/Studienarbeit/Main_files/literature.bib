  abstract = {ABSTRACT In this article, we introduce the use of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) as a technique for uncovering the intellectual structure of a discipline. LSA is an emerging quantitative method for content analysis that combines rigorous statistical techniques and scholarly judgment as it proceeds to extract and decipher key latent factors. We provide a stepwise explanation and illustration for implementing LSA. To demonstrate LSA's ability to uncover the intellectual structure of a discipline, we present a study of the field of Operations Management. We also discuss a number of potential applications of LSA to show how it can be used in empirical Operations Management research, specifically in areas that can benefit from analyzing large volumes of unstructured textual data.

  abstractnote = {NLP (natural language processing) is a very broad subcategory of computer science that focuses on human language processing in computers. Each different NLP processing technique focuses on different parts of linguistics, with semantics being the main focus of this manuscript. This manuscript aims to utilize a systematic review of several published papers ranging from 1998 to the current day to review and summarize critical analysis regarding the three main models that this paper focuses on: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA), and Neural Network based models. This manuscript compares these models against each other, weighs their advantages and disadvantages, and provides their uses. The selected studies in this review were analyzed and examined to ensure that they meet the quality and standards of the proposed research methodology. The results show that Neural network-based solutions are the most popular Semantic Analysis model in Academia (doubling the number of results of ESA and LSA combined), and they are usually the best in most tasks. However, there are specific scenarios and circumstances in which relying on the older LSA and ESA models could be beneficial.},

@article{TextMiningUsingLatentSemanticAnalysis,
  abstract = {Big Data presents a tremendous challenge for the accounting profession today. This challenge is characterized by, among other things, the explosive growth of unstructured data, such as text. In recent years, new text-mining methods have emerged to turn unstructured textual data into actionable information. A critical role of accounting information systems (AIS) research is to help the accounting profession assess and utilize these methodologies in an accounting context. This paper introduces the latent semantic analysis (LSA), a text-mining approach that discovers latent structures in unstructured textual data, to the AIS research community. An LSA-based approach is used to analyze AIS research as published in the &lt;italic&gt;Journal of Information Systems&lt;/italic&gt; (&lt;italic&gt;JIS&lt;/italic&gt;) over the last 30 years. &lt;italic&gt;JIS&lt;/italic&gt; research serves as an appropriate domain of analysis because of a perceived need to contextualize the scope of AIS research.
